"""chain_of_thought — step-by-step map each sentence to an aspect, then select.

Registered twice for the trace ablation:
  chain_of_thought        -> one-shot example is answer-only
  chain_of_thought_trace  -> one-shot example is the 397B reasoning trace
Only one-shot differs, so _trace is one-shot only.
