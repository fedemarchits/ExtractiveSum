"""negative_aware — one-shot only. The example highlights near-miss negatives:
sentences that look relevant but must NOT be selected. Reduces false positives
and sharpens aspect boundaries.

One-shot by nature: the whole point is showing the negatives, so there is no
zero-shot variant (restricted via shots=).
