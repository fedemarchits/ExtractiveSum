"""contrastive_joint — classify each sentence as challenge/approach/outcome/none,
then keep those labeled with the target aspect.

zero-shot: contrastive classification in one pass.
one-shot : the "joint_self_ask" form. NOTE: ACLSum gold gives only the target
           aspect's labels per call, not a full 4-way labeling, so the example
           shows the target-vs-not-target boundary (real gold) rather than a
           fabricated full 4-way trace. Reduces cross-aspect false positives.
